# Product Vision: Action Atlas

## Problem Statement

Event organizers struggle to discover and connect with non-profit organizations offering meaningful activities for their events. This creates friction in organizing events with social impact:

- **Discovery gap**: Non-profit activities are scattered across disconnected channels
- **Contact friction**: Finding the right person to coordinate with takes multiple touchpoints
- **Time waste**: Organizers spend hours researching and reaching out individually
- **Missed opportunities**: Great non-profit activities go unused due to lack of visibility

## Target Users

### Primary: Event Organizers
- Corporate event planners organizing team-building, conferences, or CSR initiatives
- Community organizers planning festivals, fairs, or local gatherings
- Educational institutions organizing student events or awareness campaigns

**Characteristics**: Time-constrained, value simplicity, need reliable contacts, want to add social impact to their events.

### Secondary: Non-Profit Organizations
- Small to medium non-profit organizations with outreach activities
- Organizations seeking visibility and partnership opportunities
- Teams with limited marketing resources

**Characteristics**: Need exposure, have valuable activities to offer, struggle with discoverability.

## Value Proposition

**For event organizers**: A centralized platform to discover non-profit activities and instantly access verified contacts — transforming days of research into minutes of browsing.

**For non-profits**: A channel to showcase activities and connect with event organizers seeking social impact partnerships — turning passive waiting into active visibility.

## MVP Scope

### In-Scope Features

1. **Activity Discovery**
   - Browse non-profit activities with basic filtering (category, location, type)
   - View activity details (description, requirements, target audience)
   - Search by keywords

2. **Contact Information**
   - Display verified contact details for each non-profit
   - Show primary contact person and role
   - Provide email and phone contact methods

3. **Non-Profit Profiles**
   - Basic organization profile (name, mission, location)
   - List of activities offered by each organization
   - Simple activity submission form

4. **Basic Admin Tools**
   - Manual review/approval workflow for new activities
   - Basic content moderation capabilities

### Explicitly Out-of-Scope (for MVP)

- User authentication or accounts
- Booking/reservation system
- Payment processing
- Direct messaging between organizers and non-profits
- Reviews or ratings
- Advanced filtering (availability calendars, capacity matching)
- Multi-language support
- Mobile applications
- Integration with external calendars or CRM tools
- Analytics dashboard for non-profits
- Automated matching or recommendations

## Key Assumptions

1. **Market demand**: Event organizers actively seek non-profit activities and face discovery challenges
2. **Supply willingness**: Non-profits will voluntarily submit their activities to gain visibility
3. **Contact sufficiency**: Providing contact information is sufficient for MVP; organizers will handle outreach themselves
4. **Manual curation**: Early-stage manual moderation is acceptable and adds quality control
5. **Public access**: An open, no-authentication platform will drive initial adoption
6. **Simple onboarding**: Non-profits can describe their activities via a basic form

## Non-Goals

- **Not a marketplace**: We don't facilitate transactions or take commission
- **Not a CRM**: We don't manage ongoing relationships between organizers and non-profits
- **Not an event management tool**: We don't handle event logistics, ticketing, or attendee management
- **Not a social network**: No profiles, following, or social features for users
- **Not a review platform**: No rating system or user-generated reviews (at MVP stage)

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Activity catalog size**: Number of verified activities listed
- **Platform usage**: Unique visitors per month
- **Contact access rate**: Percentage of visitors who view contact details

### Secondary Metrics
- **Non-profit acquisition**: Number of organizations with profiles
- **Geographic coverage**: Number of regions/cities represented
- **Search effectiveness**: Percentage of searches returning results

### Validation Metrics (Post-Launch)
- **Conversion intent**: Qualitative feedback from organizers about follow-through
- **Non-profit satisfaction**: Feedback on inquiries received
- **Return usage**: Percentage of organizers returning for subsequent events

## Guiding Principles

1. **Simplicity first**: Every feature must justify its complexity
2. **Organizer-centric**: Optimize for the discovery and contact flow
3. **Quality over quantity**: Better to have 20 well-documented activities than 200 unclear ones
4. **Low barrier to entry**: Non-profits should be able to list activities in minutes
5. **Transparency**: All information public and accessible without friction
